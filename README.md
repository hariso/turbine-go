Turbine is a data application framework for building server-side applications that are event-driven, respond to data in real-time, and scale using cloud-native best practices.

The benefits of using Turbine include:

* **Native Developer Tooling:** Turbine doesn't come with any bespoke DSL or patterns. Write software like you normally would!

* **Fits into Existing DevOps Workflows:** Build, test, and deploy. Turbine encourages best practices from the start. Don't test your data app in production ever again.

* **Local Development mirrors Production:** When running locally, you'll immediately see how your app reacts to data. What you get there will be exactly what happens in production but with _scale_ and _speed_.

* **Available in many different programming langauages:** Turbine started out in Go but is available in other languages too:
    * [Go](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine)
    * [Javascript](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine-js)
    * [Python](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine-py)


## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to [download the Meroxa CLI](). Once downloaded and installed, you'll need to initialize a project like so in your terminal:

```bash
$ meroxa apps init testapp --lang=golang
```

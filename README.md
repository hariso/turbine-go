Turbine is a data application framework for building server-side applications that are event-driven, respond to data in real-time, and scale using cloud-native best practices.

The benefits of using Turbine include:

* **Native Developer Tooling:** Turbine doesn't come with any bespoke DSL or patterns. Write software like you normally would!

* **Fits into Existing DevOps Workflows:** Build, test, and deploy. Turbine encourages best practices from the start. Don't test your data app in production ever again.

* **Local Development mirrors Production:** When running locally, you'll immediately see how your app reacts to data. What you get there will be exactly what happens in production.


## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to [download the Meroxa CLI](). Once downloaded and installed, you'll need to initialize a project like so in your terminal:

```bash
$ meroxa apps init testapp --lang=golang
```

That's it! You've got everything you need to build a Turbine app. Some instructions exist in the code to help describe what needs to be done. For more detail, see the [Turbine documentation](https://docs.meroxa.com/documentation).

Currently, the Meroxa CLI provides all of the commands necessary to create, build, test, and deploy Turbine applications.

If you're interested in building turbine apps in other languages, associated Turbine libraries exist for:

* [Go](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine)
* [Javascript](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine-js)
* [Python](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine-py)


## Documentation

# Turbine

![turbine logo](./docs/turbine.png)

Turbine is a data application framework for building server-side applications that are event-driven and respond to data in real-time.

The benefits of using Turbine include:
* asfdas
* asdf


## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to [download the Meroxa CLI](). Once downloaded and installed, you'll need to initialize a project like so in your terminal:

```bash
$ meroxa apps init testapp --lang=golang
```

That's it! You've got everything you need to build a Turbine app. Some instructions exist in the code to help describe what needs to be done. For more detail, see the [Turbine documentation](https://docs.meroxa.com/documentation).

Currently, the Meroxa CLI provides all of the commands necessary to create, build, test, and deploy Turbine applications.

If you're interested in building turbine apps in other languages, associated Turbine libraries exist for:

* [Go](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine)
* [Javascript](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine-js)
* [Python](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine-py)


## Documentation

The most comprehensive documentation for Turbine and how to work with Turbine apps is on the Meroxa site: [https://docs.meroxa.com/](https://docs.meroxa.com)
